FONTS & FORMATS
===============

There are a large variety of fonts and document languages residing in the
computer world these days.  This is particularly true of the Ge'ez fonts
on the market today where each font provider has used a different encoding
system.  This means that reading (se)(la)(m) with one font may turn into
meaningly garble with another Ge'ez font -just as unintelligible as if you
had tried viewing with a Roman (aka English) font.

This is where Ge'ezXfer comes in, to decipher the garble and allow you to
read a "Ge'ezigna" document when you have "Washra" fonts on your computer.
This document will explain the conversion possibilities available with 
Ge'ezXfer.


First some terminologies we will use.  
<
  Say something brief about the distinction between character code and
  document sysetms
>

RTF stands for "Rich Text Format" it is a document system used mainly on
personal computers.  RTF has the ability to save fancy text formatting and 
graphics and TrueType Ethiopic fonts.  TrueType fonts that Ge'ezXfer knows
about are:


"Agafari" which refers to one of the four fonts of the Ethiopian Science and
  Technology Commision: AGF - Ejji Tsihuf, AGF - Rejim, AGF - Yigezu Bisrat,
  and AGF - Zemen.

"ALX Ethiopian" "Ge'ezEdit", and "Ge'ezFree" correspond directly to their
  font names.

"Feedel" refers to the "Ge'ezigna" font of Feedel Software.

"Washra" which refers to any of the EthiO Systems fonts using Ethiopian ASCII,
  supported fonts are "Washra", "YebSe", and "Ethiopia".


Plain text (aka "DOS Text" or "ASCII Text") does not use a special language to
preserve special features like graphics or underlines, and font sizes.  Only
the most simple text formatting is possible such as tabbing and returns.

JIS and JUNET are plain text format systems using the Unicode specification for
Ethiopic script.  Both are text systems used on computers and networks primarily
for the encoding of Japanese text.  Both use the Unicode character sequence for
Ethiopic but not with the same character addresses.  "jis" and "jun" are 
abbreviations we will use later.

UNI and UTF-8 are both Unicode sytems.  UNI is "raw" 2-byte Unicode. UTF-8 
is the more common but uses a 3-byte encoding of the Ethiopic Unicode
definition where decoded addresses do correspond directly to the Unicode system.
"uni" and "utf8" will be our abbreviations.

SERA is a transliteration system for Ethiopic script that is independent of
character code and document systems. SERA is used mainly with plain text and
sometimes HTML documents.

ISO/TC46/SC2 and IES are other transliteration systems available.
ISO/TC46/SC2 is a developing standard that translates Ethiopic into a single
case Latin system.  IES is the system used by the Institute of Ethiopian
Studies, it also requires that TeX or LaTeX be used as the output document
type.  "iso" and "ies" are abbreviations we will use later.

TeX and LaTeX are high quality print formatting systems.  They are again
document systems, only EthiO Systems has to date developed Ethiopic "Metafonts"
for TeX and LaTeX.  "etmf" is an abbreviation we will use later.

HTML is an Internet standard for publishing Hyper Text documents, generally on
the World Wide Web.  HTML has a way to work with TrueType fonts as well as the
JIS, UTF-8, and SERA systems.



Other Fonts & Formats?
---------------------
We would like to add them!  Font and document systems that are unsupported
at this time are probably due to lack of information about the system.  If
you are a font vendor and would like your font supported, please contact us
about doing so.




RTF -> RTF
===========

In  :  { Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra }
Out :  { Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra }

Most popular software used for word processing, spreadsheets, and databases
provide a "Save As... ...RTF" option.  With the Rich Text Format document
system you may import and export between a large variety of software (even
read databases into spreadsheets and the like) as well as to other computer
systems (Mac, OS/2, UNIX).  The Windows '95 "WordPad" and Windows 3.x "Write"
are two simple file editors coming with Windows that are capable of reading
and saving RTF files.

Given this versatility of RTF it seemed to the developers of Ge'ezXfer to be
the best system suited for converting between the different Ge'ez font systems.

With this option Ge'ezXfer will search through an RTF file and "find & replace"
Ge'ez font names and letters with the new font you have selected.  By default,
when a Windows TrueType font is selected as the new font, the RTF document
system is used.

Example:  "file.rtf" is an RTF input file that uses a TrueType font.

  gez2 -out washra.rtf  file.rtf > newfile.rtf

or

  gez2 -out washra  file.rtf > newfile.rtf
        since Washra is a TrueType font it is already assumed to use RTF.



RTF -> PLAIN TEXT
==================

In  :  { Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra }
Out :  { sera, iso, jis, uni, utf8 }


The Rich Text Format to Plain Text conversion should be used when converting
text from a Windows TrueType font system into a 7 or 8 bit text system such
as SERA (7bit), JIS, or UTF-8 (8 bit systems).

For Fidel systems needing only one font (Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, 
& Ge'ezEdit) the files _could_ be outputed as plain text, however the Windows
"WordPad" and "Write" are also available for this purpose (RTF->TEXT).  Be
aware that saving in text files you will loose fancy text and formating such
as bold and italic fonts or tables and graphics.


Example:  "file.rtf" is an RTF input file that uses a TrueType font.

  gez2 -out utf8.txt  file.rtf > newfile.txt

or

  gez2 -out utf8  file.rtf > file.txt
        since UTF8 is assumed to be a text system.



RTF -> TEX/LATEX
=================

In  :  { Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra }
Out :  { etmf, ies }

With the Rich Text Format to TeX option you may convert a file composed in a
Windows, Mac, or OS/2 software into the TeX or LaTeX publishing system.  Be
aware of the limitation that formatting in the RTF file is NOT translated
into the TeX or LaTeX equivalents.


Example:  "file.rtf" is an RTF input file that uses a TrueType font.

  gez2 -out etmf.tex  file.rtf > file.tex

or

  gez2 -out ies.ltx  file.rtf > file.ltx
       -out ies      file.rtf > file.ltx 
       -out etmf     file.rtf > file.ltx 

LaTeX (.ltx) is the default document type for the ies and etmf systems.



PLAIN TEXT -> RTF
=================

In  :  { sera }
Out :  { Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra }

With this option you can convert plain text files from SERA into a popular
Windows font system for viewing and further editing.  UTF-8 and UTF-7 will
likely be text option coming in the future.




PLAIN TEXT -> PLAIN TEXT
========================

In  :  { sera }
Out :  { iso, jis, jun, uni, utf8 }

With this option Ge'ezXfer will convert between plain text systems for Ge'ez.
In the cases of JIS and UTF-8 




PLAIN TEXT -> HTML
==================

In  :  { sera }
Out :  { Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra }


With this option you may convert a SERA HTML file into an HTML file using a
TrueType font.  Ge'ezXfer will properly provide <font face="YYYY"> corrections
for mulitple font systems.  Adding the initial <font face="XXXX"> HTML tag is
work left for you.




PLAIN TEXT -> TEX/LATEX 
=================

In  :  { sera }
Out :  { etmf, ies }

With this option you may simply convert SERA files in to the TeX or LaTeX
publishing system.




HTML -> ????
============

At the moment Ge'ezXfer does NOT offer conversion between different font systems 
encoded in HTML files.  But will shortly.  If the font system in the HTML file
uses only one Ge'ez font, you can try your luck now by requesting Ge'ezXfer to
convert the file as if it were PLAIN TEXT.



================================================================================

Tables of Character Occurances
==============================

Ge'ezXfer has an option to print tables of character counts (i.e. the
number of times (he) is found in a document or (lWa)).  See the manual
for how to select the tables option.  When tables of character counts
are printed, you will again have choices for your document and font
system.  Possibilities are:


Table In RTF 
------------
 SERA, Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra 




Table In HTML
-------------
 SERA, JIS, UTF-8, Agafari, ALX Ethiopian, Feedel, Ge'ezEdit, Ge'ezFree, Washra 




Table In Plain Text
-------------------
 SERA, JIS, UTF-8




Table In Plain TeX
-------------------
  EthiO Systems Metafont, SERA, <add IES phonetic transcription later>
