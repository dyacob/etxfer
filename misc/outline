ethXfer

Purpose:  To convert character codes from one Ethiopic system into another.

Will Read In:  
  SERA, ISO/TC46/SC2 (maybe), Unicode (UCS-7,8,16), Agafari, ALXEthiopian,
  Dashen, Feedel, ModEth, Monoyype, NCI, Phonetic Systems.  Read in is
  supported for RTF where applicable.

Will Write Out:
  All of "Read In" Above, Java, JIS, JUNET, TeX.  These systems will have a
  low priority for input support as they probably require starting points
  in a supported system to later be converted to JIS, etc..  Write out is
  supported for RTF where applicable.


Phases of Development
---------------------

1)  Command line tool for unix systems, concurrent development under Java.
2)  Read In SERA initially with Write Out in described sytems above.
3)  Read In of MS Windows Based fonts systems added for ANSI text and RTF.
4)  GUI Added under X11 (Java version may have this sooner).
5)  File viewing capability added to X interface.
   (Java version has this with editor from the beginning)
6)  LibEth DLL and VB Interface for Windows 3.x users.  This tool uses the
    GT public domain TT fonts.

Later additional I/O features and an editing features may be added to the
X11 and VB versions.
