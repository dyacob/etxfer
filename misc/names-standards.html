Draft Java Coding Standard
</H1>

by <a href="http://g.oswego.edu/">Doug Lea</a>. Last revised May 29 1996.

<p>
Note: The form of these guidelines is based on examples in Watts
Humphrey's book <em>A Discipline for Software Engineering</em>,
Addison-Wesley, 1995.

<h2>
Packages and directories 
</h3>

Create a new java <CODE>package</CODE> for each self-contained project
or group of related functionality.  Create and use directories in
accord with java <CODE>package</CODE> conventions.  Consider writing
an <code>index.html</code> file in each directory briefly outlining
the purpose and structure of the package.

<h2>
Program Files
</h3>


Place each class in a separate file. This applies even to non-public 
classes (which are allowed by the Java compiler to be placed
in the same file as the main class using them) except in the
case of one-shot usages where the non-public class cannot conceivably
be used outside of its context.
<P>
For self-standing programs, the class with <CODE>main</CODE>
should be separate from those containing normal classes.


<h3>
File Headers
</h3>

Begin each file with a comment including:
<OL>
  <LI> The file name
      and/or related identifying information including, if 
      applicable, copyright information.  
  <LI> A history table listing dates, authors, 
      and summaries of changes.
  <LI> If the file contains more than one class, list the
      classes, along with a very brief description of each.
      
  <LI> If the file introduces a principal entry point for a
      <CODE>package</CODE>, briefly describe the rationale for
      constructing the package.
</OL>
     <P>

<h2>
Documentation
</h2>     

Write all <CODE>/** ... **/</CODE> comments using <EM>javadoc</EM>
conventions.  (Even though not required by javadoc, end each
<CODE>/**</CODE> comment with <CODE>**/</CODE> to make it easier to
read and check.)

<h3>
Classes and Interfaces
</h3>


Preface each class with a <CODE>/** ... **/</CODE> comment describing
the purpose of the class, guaranteed invariants, usage instructions,
and/or usage examples.  Also include any reminders or disclaimers
about required or desired improvements. Use HTML format, with added
tags: <UL>
  <LI> <CODE>@author</CODE>  <EM>author-name</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@version</CODE> <EM>version number of class</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>string</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>URL</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>classname#methodname</EM>
</UL>

<P>
Example:

<PRE>
/**
 * A class representing a window on the screen.
 * For example:
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 *  Window win = new Window(parent);
 * win.show();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * @see  awt.BaseWindow
 * @see  awt.Button
 * @version 1.2 31 Jan 1995
 * @author  Bozo the Clown
**/
class Window extends BaseWindow {
 ...
}
</PRE>


<h3>
Instance Variables
</h3>


Use <EM>javadoc</EM> conventions to describe nature, purpose,
constraints, and usage. Use HTML format, with added tags:
<UL>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>string</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>URL</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>classname#methodname</EM>
</UL>

<P>
Example:

<PRE>
    /**
     * The current number of elements.
     * must be non-negative, and less than or equal to capacity.
    **/
    private int count_;
</PRE>


<h3>
Methods
</h3>

Use <EM>javadoc</EM> conventions to describe nature, purpose,
preconditions, effects, algorithmic notes, usage instructions, 
reminders, etc. Use HTML format, with added tags:
<UL>
  <LI> <CODE>@param</CODE> <EM>paramName</EM> description. (Note: In 
      alpha versions of Java, this is listed as <CODE>@arg</CODE>, 
      not <CODE>@param</CODE>.)
  <LI> <CODE>@return</CODE> description of return value
  <LI> <CODE>@exception</CODE> <EM>exceptionName</EM> description 
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>string</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>URL</EM>
  <LI> <CODE>@see</CODE>  <EM>classname#methodname</EM>
</UL>

<P>
Be as precise as reasonably possible in documenting effects.
Here are some standard conventions for semi-formal specifications.
<UL>
  <LI> Use <CODE>@return condition</CODE> to describe 
      postconditions and effects
      true upon return of a method.
      
  <LI> Use <CODE>PREV(obj)</CODE>  to refer to the state of an object
      at the onset of a method.
      
  <LI> Use <CODE>OUT(message)</CODE>  to describe messages that are
      sent to other objects as required aspects of functionality,
      or referrred to in describing the effects of other methods.
      And similarly <CODE>IN(message)</CODE> for messages that are received.
      
  <LI> Use <CODE>foreach (int i in lo .. hi) predicate</CODE> to
      means that predicate holds for each value of i.
      
      
  <LI> Use <CODE>foreach (Object x in e) predicate </CODE> to mean 
      that the predicate holds for each element of a collection
      or enumeration.
      
  <LI> Use <CODE>foreach (Type x) predicate </CODE> to mean 
      that the predicate holds for each instance of <code>Type</code>.
      
  <LI> Use <CODE>--&gt;</CODE> to means `implies'.
      
  <LI> Use ``Behaviorally equivalent to <CODE>{ code segment }</CODE>''
      to document convenience or specialized methods that can be 
      defined in terms of a few operations using other methods.
      
  <li> Use <code>RELY(predicate)</code> to describe assumptions
      about execution context (for example relying on lack of concurrent
      execution of other methods).
</UL>

<P>
Example:

<PRE>
  /**
   * Insert element at front of the sequence
   *     
   * @param element the element to add
   * @return condition:
   * &lt;PRE&gt;
   *  size() == PREV(this).size()+1 &&
   *  at(0).equals(element) &&
   *  foreach (int i in 1..size()-1) at(i).equals(PREV(this).at(i-1)) 
   * &lt;/PRE&gt;
  **/

  public void        addFirst(Object element);
</PRE>

<h3>
Internal Comments
</h3>


Use <CODE>/* ... */</CODE> comments to describe algorithmic
details, notes, and related documentation that spans more than
a few code statements.
<P>
Example:

<PRE>
    /*
     * Strategy:
     *    1. Find the node
     *    2. Clone it
     *    3. Ask inserter to add clone 
     *    4. If successful, delete node
     */
</PRE>

Use Running <CODE>//</CODE> comments to clarify non-obvious code.
But don't bother adding such comments to obvious code;
instead try to make code obvious!
<P>
Example:

<PRE>
int index = -1; // -1 serves as flag meaning the index isn't valid
</PRE>

<h2>
Some Coding Guidelines
</h2>


Here are some rules of thumb that tend to avoid common errors and
development obstacles:


<dl>

      
  <dt> Never declare instance variables as public.
  <dd> Rationale: The standard OO reasons. Making variables public gives
      up control over internal class structure. Also, methods cannot
      assume that variables have valid values.
<p>

  <dt> Avoid unnecessary instance variable access and update methods.
      Write <code>get/set</code>-style methods only when they are
      intrinsic aspects of functionality.
  <dd> Rationale:
      Most instance variables in most classes must maintain values
      that are dependent on those of other instance
      variables. Allowing them to be read or written in isolation
      makes it harder to ensure that consistent sets of values are
      always used.
<p>


  <dt> Use comment conventions to indicate whether instance variables
      that never have their values
      changed after construction are intended to be constant (immutable)
      for the lifetime of the object (versus those that just so
      happen not to get assigned in a class, but could in a subclass).
  <dd> Rationale:
      Access to immutable instance variables generally does not
      require any synchronization control, but others generally do.
<p>
      
  <dt> Minimize statics (except for static final constants).
  <dd> Rationale: Static variables act like globals in non-OO languages.
      They make methods more context-dependent, hide possible
      side-effects, sometimes present synchronized access
      problems. and are the source of fragile, non-extensible
      constructions. Also, neither static variables nor methods are
      overridable in any useful sense in subclasses.
<p>

  <dt> Generally prefer <CODE>long</CODE> to <CODE>int</CODE>,
      and <code>double</code> to <code>float</code>.  But use
      <CODE>int</CODE> for compatibility with standard Java constructs
      and classes (for the major example, array indexing, and all of
      the things this implies, for example about maximum sizes of
      arrays, etc).
  <dd> Rationale:
      Arithmetic overflow and underflow can be 4 billion times less
      likely with longs than <code>ints</code>; similarly, fewer
      precision problems occur with <code>doubles</code> than
      <code>floats</code>.  On the other hand, because of limitations
      in Java atomicity guarantees, use of longs and doubles must be
      synchronized in cases where use of ints and floats sometimes
      would not be.
<p>


  <dt> Generally prefer <code>protected</code> to <code>private</code>.
  <dd> Rationale: Unless you have good reason for sealing-in a particular
      strategy for using a variable or method, you might as well plan
      for change via subclassing. On the other hand, this almost
      always entails more work. Basing other code in a base class
      around <code>protected</code> variables and methods is harder,
      since you you have to either loosen or check assumptions about
      their properties. (Note that in Java, <code>protected</code>
      methods are also accessible from unrelated
      classes in the same package. There is hardly every any reason to
      exploit this though.)
      
      <p>
      
  <dt> Minimize direct internal access to instance variables inside methods.
      Use <code>protected</code> access and update methods instead (or
      sometimes <code>public</code> ones if they exist anyway).
  <dd> Rationale: While inconvenient and sometimes overkill, this allows
      you to vary synchronization and notification policies associated
      with variable access and change in the class and/or its
      subclasses, which is otherwise a serious impediment to
      extensiblity in concurrent OO programming.  (Note: The
      underscore convention for instance variables serves as an
      annoying reminder of such issues.)  <p>
      
  <dt> Avoid overloading methods on argument type. (Overriding on
      arity is OK, as in having a one-argument version versus a two-argument
      version). If you need to specialize behavior according
      to the class of an argument, consider instead choosing
      a general type for the
      nominal argument type (often <code>Object</code>) and using
      conditionals checking <code>instanceof</code>. Alternatives
      include techniques such as double-dispatching, or often best,
      reformulating methods (and/or those of their arguments)
      to remove dependence on exact argument type.
  <dd> Rationale: Java method resolution is static; based on
      the listed types, not the actual types of argument. This is
      compounded in the case of non-Object types with coercion
      charts. In both cases, most programmers have not committed the
      matching rules to memory. The results can be counterintuitive;
      thus the source of subtle errors.  For example, try to predict
      the output of this. Then compile and run.

<pre>
class Classifier {
  String identify(Object x)  { return "object"; }
  String identify(Integer x) { return "integer"; }
}

class Relay {
  String relay(Object obj) { return (new Classifier()).identify(obj); }
}

public class App {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Relay relayer = new Relay();
    Integer i = new Integer(17);
    System.out.println(relayer.relay(i));
  }
}
</pre>    

    <p>

  <dt> Write methods that only do ``one thing''. In particular,
      separate out methods that change object state from those that
      just rely upon it. For a classic example in a
      <code>Stack</code>, prefer having two methods <code>Object
      top()</code> and <code>void removeTop()</code> versus the single
      method <code>Object pop()</code> that does both.
  <dd> Rationale:
      This simplifies (sometimes, makes even possible) concurrency
      control and subclass-based extensions.  <p>
      
  <dt> Define return types as <CODE>void</CODE>  unless they return 
      results that are not (easily) accessible otherwise. (i.e.,
      hardly ever write <CODE>return this</CODE>).
  <dd> Rationale: While convenient, the resulting method cascades
      (<code>a.meth1().meth2().meth3()</code>) can be the sources of
      synchronization problems and other failed expectations about the
      states of target objects.  <p>
      
  <dt> Declare all public methods as synchronized; or if not,  describe the 
      assumed invocation context and/or rationale for lack of
      synchronization.
  <dd> Rationale: In the absence of planning out a set of concurrency
      control policies, declaring methods as synchronized at least
      guarantees safety (although not necessarily liveness) in
      concurrent contexts (<em>every</em> Java program is concurrent
      to at least some minimal extent). With full synchronization of
      all methods, the methods may lock up, but the object can never
      enter in randomly inconsistent states (and thus engage in
      stupidly or even dangerously wrong behaviors) due to concurrency
      conflicts.  If you are worried about efficiency problems due to
      synchronization, learn enough about concurrent OO programming to
      plan out more efficient and/or less deadlock-prone policies.
<p>

  <dt> If you override Object.equals, also override Object.hashCode,
     and vice-versa.

  <dd> Rationale: Essentially all containers and other utilities that
      group or compare objects in ways depending on equality rely on
      hashcodes to indicate possible equality.  <p>
      
  <dt> Don't invoke <CODE>clone()</CODE> unless you know 
      what its implementation does (e.g., shallow vs deep copying).
      Conversely, if you think that clone() may be called in a class
      you write, then explicitly define it.
      
  <dd> Rationale: As of Java 1.0, such considerations are nearly
      enforced automatically, via the <code>Cloneable</code> interface
      and its conventions.
<p>

  <dt> Always embed <code>wait</code> statements in <code>while</code>
      loops that re-wait if the condition being waited for does not
      hold.
  <dd> Rationale: When a <code>wait</code> wakes up, it does not know
      if the condition it is waiting for is true or not.  <p>
      
  <dt> Use <code>notifyAll</code> instead of <code>notify</code> or
      <code>resume</code>.
  <dd> Rationale:
      Classes that use only <code>notify</code> can normally only
      support at most one kind of wait condition across all methods in
      the class and all possible subclasses. And unguarded
      <code>suspends/resumes</code> are even more fragile.  <p>
      
  <dt> Whenever reasonable, define a default (no-argument) constructor
      so objects can be created via Class.newInstance().
  <dd> Rationale: This allows classes of types unknown at compile
      time to be dynamically loaded and instantiated (as is done for
      example when loading unknown Applets from html pages).  <p>
      
  <dt> Declare a class as final only if it is a subclass or
      implementation of a class or interface declaring all of its
      non-implementation-specific methods. (And similarly for
      final methods).
      
  <dd> Rationale: Making a class final means that no one ever has a chance to
      reimplement functionality. Defining it instead to be a subclass
      of a base that is not final means that someone at least gets a
      chance to subclass the base with an alternate implementation.
      Which will essentially always happen in the long run.  <p>
      
  <dt> If you can conceive of someone else implementing a class's
      functionality differently, define an interface, not an abstract
      class. Generally, use abstract classes only when they are
      ``partially abstract''; i.e., they implement some functionality
      that must be shared across all subclasses.
      
  <dd> Rationale:
      Interfaces are more flexible than abstract classes. They support
      multiple inheritance and can be used as `mixins' in otherwise
      unrelated classes.  <p>
      
  <dt> Prefer <code>abstract</code> methods in base classes to those
      with default no-op implementations. (Also, if there is a common
      default implementation, consider instead writing it as a
      <code>protected</code> method so that subclass authors can just
      write a one-line implementation to call the default.)
  <dd> Rationale: The Java compiler will force subclass authors to
      implement <code>abstract</code> methods, avoiding problems
      occurring when they forget to do so but should have.
      
      <p>
      
  <dt> Minimize <CODE>*</CODE> forms of <CODE>import</CODE>. Be precise
      about what you are importing. 
      
  <dd> Rationale:
      Otherwise readers of your code will have a hard time understanding
      its context and dependencies. Some people even prefer not
      using <code>import</code> at all (thus requiring that every
      class reference be fully dot-qualified), which avoids all possible
      ambiguity at the expense of requiring more source code changes if package
      names change.
      <p>
      
  <dt> Do not require 100% conformance to rules of thumb such as
      the ones listed here!
  <dd> Rationale: Java allows you program in ways that do not
      conform to these rules for good reason. Sometimes 
      they provide the only reasonable ways to implement things.
      And some of these rules make programs less efficient than they
      might otherwise be, so are meant to be concientiously broken
      when performance is an issue.
      Style guidelines such as this are often usefully viewed as
      checklists for retrospective code clean-up when classes
      need to be used in new contexts or placed in reusable libraries.
