Things That Could Be Done
-------------------------

  The ChangeList could be incorporated in the fi struct
   -check if there are any functions where ChangeList is passed and not fi

  Fout variables could be promoted to a lethFlag element -this would become
  useful very quickly!


Do Soon
-------
  *  plain2rtf does NOT seem to switch fonts, fix!!!! (1 hour)
     -it is not being passed the _last_ isGez.
  *  output to sera does not use \ 
  *  verify!  rtf2TeX and plain2TeX         (1 hour)
  *  verify!  Statistics, RTF Statistics    (2 hours)
  *  Fix Feedel (other?) -> Unicode problem around Hi & Ha and elsewhere

  *  EOF bug (?)

Do Later
--------
  revamp command line flags     (30 minutes)


  Add Other EthiO Systems fonts (need names only)

  Add ModEth Tables   (need to print and get addresses)
  Add MonoType Tables (write monotype, see if they still sell these)

  Add Alpas Tables            (need fonts)
  Add NCI Tables
  Add ED Tables
  Add Brana Tables
  Add VisualGeez Tables       (need fonts)
  Add Phonetic Systems Tables (need fonts, write yemane rusom)

  Add Dashen Tables   (wait for user request)

  Test on LARGE rtf files from MS Word & Excell


DONE
----
X  move sout_java and sout_tex into get_fchar.l (1 hour)
X  do SERA as input hence merge the codes...
X  SERA/Other Text Output        (need "rtf_stripout" routine 2-4 hours)
X  replace libeth booleans rtf & html with a "mime" variable
X  which recognizes "html", "rtf", and "text", expand this later to
X  include the IOput variable with a full mime "Content Type" and
X  "Charset"

X  \ and EOL seems to be eaten these days, fix...
X  why isn't RTFMAP being used?

X Restructure code
X Add Command line options and SERA Flags
X Catch { and }
X Complete escape check list

X reassemble code from bug work arounds
X  o make read in arbitrary, that is NOT specified at the command line
X    all known ethiopic fonts will be replaced with the target.

X Update SERA Lexer
X   Remove latin escapes
X   "e3" -> ea
X   \~lang~lang
X   create seraflags if sent as null
X   add gezfree


Test Types
----------
X Single System => Singe  (feedel -> Alxet)
X Multi System => Single  (washra -> Feedel)

X Single System => Multi  (feedel -> Washra)
X o Try when a Washrax \f# proceeds Washra in the body of the text, 
X   make sure the isGez var updates properly.

X Multi System => Multi  (Gezfree -> Washra)
X                        (Washrasl -> Washra)
